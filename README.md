Module 2 Challenge

This VBA program analyzes a set of stock ticker data and displays:
  -The yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
  -The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
  -The total stock volume of the stock
  -Uses conditional formatting that highlights positive change in green and negative change in red

*BONUS*
  -The program also runs through every worksheet at once and returns the stocks with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume"
